# Fast Todo
### A sample project that aims to show how to integrate an REST API, Ember.JS App and an Android App (maybe iOS too).

The main goal of this project is to create a todo-list manager where the user can manage his tasks on the web app and mobile app. The main technologies I am using are:

| REST API        |   Web App       | Android         |
| :-------------  | :-------------  | :-------------  |
| Rails           |   Ember.JS      | Android SDK     |
